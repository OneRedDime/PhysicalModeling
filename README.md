# Physical Modeling

This repository contains 3 applications I wrote for a member of SDSU faculty to
assist in his physics classroom instructions.

## Running an application
Visual Studio is required, and these applications only work on Windows. After
cloning this repository, launch the desired solution and build the project.

## General use
Each application is an entirely local win-forms app. Each has a help page built
into it to describe the proper use and purpose of the application, but a high
level description will be provided here as well.

### Blackbody Radiation
This app illustrates how black body radiation given off an object will change
with the object's temperature. Other variables may be controlled for as well.

### Electron Orbitals
This app maps out the probability density function for finding an electron in
a hydrogen atom. You may choose to map up to 10,000 electrons.

### Thin Film Optics
Shows the relationship between refractive index, incident angle, and thickness
of medium as inputs with the %reflectance as output.
